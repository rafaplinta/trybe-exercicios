    <h2><strong>Meus amigos na Trybe!</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Luiz Lantmann</strong></li>
        <p>Esse é o parágrafo do meu amigo Luiz. <br>
        Sorte do dia: In the plot, people came to the land; the land loved them; they worked and
        struggled and had lots of children.  There was a Frenchman who talked funny
        and a greenhorn from England who was a fancy-pants but when it came to the
        crunch he was all courage.  Those novels would make you retch.
        -- Canadian novelist Robertson Davies, on the generic Canadian novel.
         </p>
       
        <li><strong>Matheus Palma</strong></li>
        <p>Esse é o parágrafo do meu amigo Palma. <br>
        Sorte do dia: Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.
        -- Mark Twain  
        </p>
        <li><strong>Matheus Ramos</strong></li>
        <p>Esse é o parágrafo do meu amigo Ramos. <br>
          Sorte do dia: You will experience a strong urge to do good; but it will pass.      
        </p>
        <li><strong>Heitor Oliveira</strong></li>
        <p> E esse é o parágrafo do meu amigo Heitor. <br>
          The camel died quite suddenly on the second day, and Selena fretted
         sullenly and, buffing her already impeccable nails -- not for the first
         time since the journey begain -- pondered snidely if this would dissolve
         into a vignette of minor inconveniences like all the other holidays spent
         with Basil.
		     -- Winning sentence, 1983 Bulwer-Lytton bad fiction contest.
